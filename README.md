# Chatbot-using-Natural Language Processing[NLP]
## Overview
This repository contains a chatbot application built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is designed to understand user input, recognize intents, and generate appropriate responses. It utilizes machine learning and deep learning frameworks to enhance its conversational capabilities.

## Features
Intent Recognition: Identifies user intents using NLP techniques.
Response Generation: Generates responses based on user input and predefined templates.
Learning Mechanism: Adapts and improves responses based on user interactions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for user interaction.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
Web Framework: Flask (or another framework if applicable)

## Acknowledgments
